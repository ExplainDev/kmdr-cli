# kmdr.sh

The CLI client for explaining complex shell commands.

kmdr provides command explanations for hundreds of programs including `git`, `docker`, `kubectl`,`npm`, `go` and more straight forward programs such as those built into `bash`.

## Installation

### With yarn

```bash
yarn global add kmdr@latest
```

### With npm

```bash
npm install kmdr --global
```

## Usage

### Explain a command

Once kmdr is installed on your system, enter `kmdr explain` to return a prompt for entering the command you would like explained.

When the `Enter your command:` prompt is returned, enter the command you would like explained and hit the `Enter` key.

kmdr will return `Syntax Highlighting` to assist you in differentiating parts of the command followed by the explanation of each of these parts.

An example explanation of `git commit -am "Initial commit"` can be seen below.

```bash
$ kmdr explain
