## Schemas

A schema is the machine-readable structure used by kmdr for organizing command descriptions.

Every program explained by kmdr has a schema with key-value pairs defining the properties of commands. There are three sets of key-value pairs which make up a schema: program, subcommand, and option. Some programs do not have subcommands or/nor options.

## Program key-value pairs

The basis of a schema is its program key-value pairs. Information about the key-value pairs <available> for a CLI program is described in Table 1.0 with `yarn` as the example program.

| Key-value pair | Definition                            | Required | Type     | Sample value |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------ |
| `name`         | The name of the program or subcommand | Yes      | `string` | "git"        |
