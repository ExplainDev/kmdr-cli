# kmdr.sh

The CLI client for explaining complex shell commands.

kmdr provides command explanations for hundreds of programs including
```git```, ```docker```, ```kubectl```,```npm```, ```go``` and
more straight forward programs such as those built into ```bash```.

## Installation

### With yarn

```bash
yarn global add kmdr
```

npm install kmdr --global
```

## Usage

### Explain a command

Once kmdr is installed on your system, enter ```kmdr explain``` to return
a prompt for entering the command you would like explained.

When the ```Explain a command:``` prompt is returned, enter the command
you would like explained and hit the ```Enter``` key.

kmdr will return ```Syntax Highlighting``` to assist you in differentiating
parts of the command followed by the explanation of each of these parts.
