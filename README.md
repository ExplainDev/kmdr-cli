## Usage

### Explain a command

Once kmdr is installed on your system, enter `kmdr explain` to return a prompt for entering the command you would like explained.

When the `Enter your command:` prompt is returned, enter the command you would like explained and hit the `Enter` key.

kmdr will return syntax highlighting to assist you in differentiating parts of the command followed by the explanation of each of these parts.

An example explanation of `git commit -am "Initial commit"` can be seen below.

```bash
$ kmdr explain
